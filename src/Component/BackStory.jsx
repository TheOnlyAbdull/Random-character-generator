        Iâ€™m Johnathan Doe, a 21-year-old developer from Nigeria. Born on
        December 11, 2004, I grew up fascinated by technology, spending
        countless nights coding and breaking things just to fix them again. My
        passion led me to build projects that solve real-world problems. When
        Iâ€™m not behind a screen, Iâ€™m exploring new ideas, gaming, or debating
        tech trends with friends. Every line of code I write brings me closer to
        shaping the future.
